## Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm passionate about programming in Python and C++, and I'm on a journey in the world of Mechatronics, specifically focusing on enterprise robotics.

## Programming Preferences

I have a strong affinity for Python and C++. These versatile languages empower me to bring robots to life and solve real-world problems through code.

```python
def main():
    print("Programming in Python and C++ fuels my passion.")
    print("Turning lines of code into robotic actions is pure magic.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
